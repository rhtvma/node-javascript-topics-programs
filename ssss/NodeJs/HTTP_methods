# PUT and PATCH are HTTP methods used to update resources on a server. 

# PUT is used to replace an entire resource, 
while PATCH is used to update a part of a resource. 

# When to use PUT?
When the client has all the data and can send it at once 
When you want to completely replace an existing resource with new data 

# When to use PATCH?
When you want to make partial updates to a resource 
When you want to update a single field or a few fields in an existing resource 
When only a subset of the resource needs to be modified 

# How PUT and PATCH work? 
PUT: Replaces the entire dataset with the data transmitted by the client
PATCH: Applies only the partial data transmitted by the client, without modifying the entire dataset

The choice between PUT and PATCH depends on the specific use case. Using the correct method can help avoid unintended consequences.
