//  Callback functions are used for Asynchronous events. Whenever any asynchronous
//  event has to be done it is generally preferred to use callbacks (if data is not nested or inter-dependent).

//  What are Promises?
//  A promise is basically an advancement of callbacks in Node.  
//  In other words, a promise is a JavaScript object which is used to handle all the asynchronous data operations.
//  While developing an application you may encounter that you are using a lot of nested callback functions.
