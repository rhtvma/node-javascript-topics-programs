What Is Authentication?
    Authentication is the process of verifying the identity of a user, ensuring they are who they claim to be. This is typically achieved through the use of credentials, such as usernames and passwords.

Authentication Best Practices
# Use HTTPS: 
    Always use HTTPS to secure data transmission between the client and server, especially when handling login credentials.

# Password Hashing: 
    Store passwords securely by hashing and salting them. Libraries like bcrypt can help with this.

# Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA): 
    Implement MFA to add an extra layer of security. This could involve something the user knows (password) and something they have (e.g., a mobile app token).

# Session Management: 
    Use secure and random session tokens to manage user sessions.


Popular Authentication Libraries
1. Passport.js
    Passport.js is a widely-used authentication library for Node.js. It supports various authentication strategies, including local (username and password), OAuth, and OpenID. 
    
    Here’s how to set up Passport.js for local authentication:

        const passport = require('passport');
        const LocalStrategy = require('passport-local').Strategy;

        passport.use(
        new LocalStrategy((username, password, done) => {
            // Verify user credentials here
            if (username === 'user' && password === 'password') {
            return done(null, { id: 1, username: 'user' });
            } else {
            return done(null, false, { message: 'Invalid credentials' });
            }
        })
        );

2. JSON Web Tokens (JWT)
    JSON Web Tokens are a popular way to implement authentication and authorization in Node.js. Users receive a token upon login, which they include in subsequent requests. 
    
    Here’s a simple example using the jsonwebtoken library:

        const jwt = require('jsonwebtoken');
        // Create a token
        const token = jwt.sign({ userId: 1 }, 'secret_key', { expiresIn: '1h' });

        // Verify a token
        jwt.verify(token, 'secret_key', (err, decodedToken) => {
        if (err) {
            console.error('Token verification failed');
        } else {
            console.log('Decoded token:', decodedToken);
        }
        });


What Is Authorization?
    Authorization defines what actions a user is allowed to perform after they’ve been authenticated. It involves granting or denying access to specific resources or functionality.

Authorization Best Practices
# Role-Based Access Control (RBAC): 
    Implement RBAC to assign roles (e.g., admin, user) to users and restrict access based on their roles.

# Middleware: 
    Use middleware functions to check a user’s permissions before granting access to a route or resource.

# Access Tokens: 
    Issue access tokens with user permissions encoded. Verify these tokens on the server-side for every request.


# Here’s a basic example of role-based authorization using middleware in Express.js:
    function checkAdmin(req, res, next) {
    if (req.user && req.user.role === 'admin') {
        next();
    } else {
        res.status(403).json({ message: 'Access denied' });
    }
    }

    // Protect a route
    app.get('/admin', checkAdmin, (req, res) => {
    res.send('Admin panel');
    });
