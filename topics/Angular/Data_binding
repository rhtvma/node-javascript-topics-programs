# Angular allows both One-way and Two-way Data Binding. We will study both of them in detail in the below section.

# One-Way Binding
In one-way binding, data flows in a single direction, 
either from the component to the view (interpolation or property binding) or from the view to the component (event binding).

1. Interpolation
    This involves displaying component data in the view by enclosing the property or expression in double curly braces, like {{ data }}. 
    Angular automatically updates the view whenever the underlying data changes.

    class="{{variable_name}}"

2. Property Binding
    This is achieved by using square brackets to bind a property of an HTML element to a component property. 
    For instance, [property]="data" binds the value of the component's "data" property to the HTML element's property

    [class]="variable_name"

3. Event Binding
    This allows the view to communicate changes back to the component when an event occurs,
    such as a button click or input change. Event binding is denoted by parentheses, like (event)="handler()".

        <button class="btn btn-block" 
            (click)=showevent($event)>
            Event
        </button>

        showevent(event) {
            alert("Welcome to ScholarHat");
        }

#  Two-Way Binding
    Two-way binding is a combination of both one-way binding for property binding and event binding. 
    It simplifies the synchronization between the component and the view by using the ngModel directive, 
    allowing changes in the view to update the component and vice versa.

    Here, the immediate changes to the view & component will be reflected automatically, 
    i.e. when the changes are made to the component or model then the view will render the changes simultaneously. Similarly, 
    when the data is altered or modified in the view then the model or component will be updated accordingly.
        
        <div style="text-align: center">
            <h1 style="color: green">
                ScholarHat 
            </h1>
            <h3>Two-way Data Binding</h3>
            <input type="text"
                placeholder="Enter text"
                [(ngModel)]="val" />
            <br />
            {{ val }} 
        </div>
