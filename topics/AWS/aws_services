=========================================================================================


1 Amazon EC2(Elastic Compute Cloud) : 
 - It provides the Scalable computing power via cloud allowing the users to run applications and manage the workloads over their remotely.

2 Amazon S3 (Simple Storage Service ): 
- It offers scalable object Storage as a Service with high durability for storing and retrieving any amount of data.

3 AWS Lambda: 
- It is a service in Serverless Architecture with Function as a Service facilitating serverless computing i.e., running the code on response to the events, the background environment management of servers is handled by aws automatically. It helps the developers to completely focus on the logic of code build.

4 Amazon RDS (Relational Database Service): 
- This is an aws service that simplifies the management of database providing high available relational databases in the cloud.

5 Amazon VPC (Virtual Private Cloud): 
- It enables the users to create isolated networks with option of public and private expose within the AWS cloud, providing safe and adaptable configurations of their resources.
