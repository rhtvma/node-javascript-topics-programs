# What is Step Functions?

    With AWS Step Functions, you can create workflows, also called State machines, 
    to build distributed applications, automate processes, orchestrate microservices, 
    and create data and machine learning pipelines.

    Step Functions is based on state machines and tasks. In Step Functions, state machines are called workflows, 
    which are a series of event-driven steps. Each step in a workflow is called a state. For example, 
    a Task state represents a unit of work that another AWS service performs, such as calling another AWS service or API. 
    Instances of running workflows performing tasks are called executions in Step Functions.

    The work in your state machine tasks can also be done using Activities which are workers that exist outside of Step Functions.

    In the Step Functions' console, you can visualize, edit, and debug your application’s workflow. 
    You can examine the state of each step in your workflow to make sure that your application runs in order and as expected.

    Depending on your use case, you can have Step Functions call AWS services, such as Lambda, to perform tasks. 
    You can have Step Functions control AWS services, such as AWS Glue, to create extract, transform, and load workflows.
    You also can create long-running, automated workflows for applications that require human interaction.

# What is AWS Lambda
    ✔ Run code without provisioning or managing servers, creating workload-aware cluster scaling logic, 
        maintaining event integrations, or managing runtimes. 

    ✔ Run code for virtually any type of application or backend service. Just upload your code as a ZIP file or container image,
         and Lambda automatically allocates compute execution power 
         and runs your code based on the incoming request or event, for any scale of traffic.
    
    Integrates with other AWS Services: AWS lambda can be integrated with different AWS services like the following :
        API Gateway
        DynamoDB
        S3
        Step Functions
        SNS
        SQS
        
# AWS Simple Storage Service (AWS S3)
    Amazon S3 bucket is a fundamental Storage Container feature in AWS S3 Service. 
    It provides a secure and scalable repository for storing of Objects such as Text data, Images, Audio and Video files over AWS Cloud. 
    Each S3 bucket name should be named globally unique and should be configured with ACL (Access Control List).
    
    Amazon S3 Bucket: Data, in S3, is stored in containers called buckets. 
    ach bucket will have its own set of policies and configurations. This enables users to have more control over their data.
    Bucket Names must be unique. Can be thought of as a parent folder of data. There is a limit of 100 buckets per AWS account.
    But it can be increased if requested by AWS support.

    Amazon S3 Objects: Fundamental entity type stored in AWS S3.You can store as many objects as you want to store. 
    The maximum size of an AWS S3 bucket is 5TB. 
        It consists of the following:
            ✔  Key
            ✔ Version ID
            ✔ Value
            ✔ Metadata
            ✔ Sub resources
            ✔ Access control information
            ✔ Tags

# VPC(Virtual Private Cloud)?
    Amazon VPC can be referred to as the private cloud inside the cloud. 
    It is a logical grouping of servers in a specified network. 
    The servers that you are going to deploy in the Virtual Private Cloud(VPC) will be completely isolated from the other servers 
    that are deployed in the Amazon Web Services. 
    You can have complete control of the IP address to the virtual machines and route tables and gateways to the VPC. 
    With the help of security groups and network access control lists, you can protect your application more.

# What Is Amazon Route 53?
    Amazon Route 53 is a highly available and scalable cloud Domain Name System (DNS) web service. 
    It is designed for developers and corporations to route the end users to Internet applications by translating human-readable names like www.google.com into the numeric IP addresses like 192.0.1.1 that computers use to connect.  
    You cannot use Amazon Route 53 to connect your on-premises network with AWS Cloud.

    # How Does Amazon Route53 Works?
        Amazon Route53 is an aws service than offers a DNS (Domain Name System) web service which is scalable and high available. It is essential for conversion of user friendly domain names into IP addresses so that internet communication can proceed without difficulties. The following are the some of the main features explaining on how Amazon Route 53 functions well:

      ✔ Domain Registration And Management: 
        Amazon Route 53 allows users to register and maintain domain names through its user-friendly interface. Users can transfer their existing domain to the Route 53 service or can go for register a new one. Users may freely configure the DNS settings, including mail server setups (MX records), domain name aliases , and more, once they have registered.
        
      ✔ Global DNS Resolution: 
        Route 53 uses a worldwidet network cast made up of many DNS servers that have been placed strategically all over the world. The IP address which matches to a domain name entered by a user in their web browser is sent back by Route 53’s DNS servers. Users can immediately access the websites and services from anywhere in the globe because of Route 53’s low latency and high-performance DNS resolution by using global network.

      ✔ Traffic Routing And Load Balancing: 
        Users can set up load balancing and fallback setups for their applications with Route 53’s wide traffic routing capabilities. Users may distribute incoming traffic among several endpoints, such as Amazon EC2 instances, Elastic Load Balancers, or by other external resources, by utilizing capabilities like DNS-based latency routing and weighted round-robin routing.

# What is Amazon CloudWatch?
    Amazon CloudWatch is a monitoring and observability service provided by Amazon Web Services (AWS) 
    that enables users to collect and track metrics, monitor log files, set alarms, and automatically react to changes in AWS resources. 
    It helps users gain insights into the operational health, performance, 
    and resource utilization of their AWS infrastructure and applications.

    # Why Amazon CloudWatch?
        Amazon Cloud Watch is a monitoring service offered by Amazon Web Services to monitor applications like the following.
        ✔ Performance.
        ✔ Health of the application.
        ✔ Monitors the resource use, etc.

# Identity and Access Management (IAM) manages Amazon Web Services (AWS) 
    users and their access to AWS accounts and services. It controls the level of access a user can have over an AWS account & set users, 
    grant permission, and allows a user to use different features of an AWS account. 
    Identity and access management is mainly used to manage users, groups, roles, 
    and Access policies The account we created to sign in to Amazon web services is known as the root account and 
    it holds all the administrative rights and has access to all parts of the account. 
    The new user created an AWS account, by default they have no access to any services in the account & 
    it is done with the help of IAM that the root account holder can implement access policies and 
    grant permission to the user to access certain services. 

    # How IAM Works?
        IAM verifies that a user or service has the necessary authorization to access a particular service in the AWS cloud. 
        We can also use IAM to grant the right level of access to specific users, groups, or services. 
        For example, we can use IAM to enable an EC2 instance to access S3 buckets by requesting fine-grained permissions.
