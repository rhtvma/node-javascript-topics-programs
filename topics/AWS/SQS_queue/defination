Amazon SQS is a fully managed distributed queueing service. 
SQS is poll-based and not push-based. Even, if it often seems like a push-based system,it is not. 
Amazon SQS is often used to decouple systems from each other and to enable asynchronous workloads.

The main pattern of SQS is to have producers send messages to a queue. 
The message remains in the queue for a defined time (by default 4 days, maximum 14 days). 
Consumers can pick up the messages on their schedule by checking the queue if any new messages are available.

If a consumer works on a message the message will be deleted if it is successful. 
Otherwise, it can also be picked up by other consumers.


// ===================

When should I use SQS?
    Reliability is important
    You have only one consumer
    Complicated retry and error handling
    Messages are picked up after some time and not instantly
